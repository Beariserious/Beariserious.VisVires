# Compile relevant icons
    Such as external links to youtube, wowprogress, Raider.io, feeds
# Bootstrap
    Consider making buttons for ^ABOVE^
    Add additional formatting to the page.
# Contact form
    Bootstrap a page that allows a contact form.
    - Could be a recruitment section? See below
# Add News
    Maybe plug in wowhead api or something to display general news.
    Pin a sticky for specific news.
    - Could use Wordpress and develop a theme using Bootstrap so that it matches the rest of the site, not sure if we want RSS Feeds as
    it's just unnecessary clutter... Should be more dedicated to news from us and V.V.
# Add "Games We Play Section"
    Vector images of games we Play
    On hover over, enlarge image of game icons
# Add About Us Section
    - Who we are, how we got started, # of members, Goals
# Add Recruitment Form/Section/Reach Out Method
